# derangements-experiment

Derangements are shuffles where no array element can remain in its original position.

This is a comparison between using Python's random.shuffle() until a valid derangement is produced,
versus a shuffle where elemetns are (in turn) swapped into positions that have not currently been
swapped into.

(Pretty much just an excuse to play with altair and pandas.)
